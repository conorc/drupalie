INSTALLATION / UNINSTALLATION
-----------------------------

1. Decompress the archive and copy the responsive_navigation folder
   into your modules folder.

     sites/all/modules

2. Install the Libraries 7.x-2.x module into your modules folder.

3. Download the responsive-nav.js plugin. The link is provided below.

   For advanced Drush 4.x+ users, type:

     drush rnjs-plugin

     or

     drush rnjsplugin (shorter alias with no dashes for the lazy)

   It will download archive and decompress and create the folder:

     sites/all/libraries/responsive_navigation

   If you don't have Drush proceed to step 4 and 5 for the manual method.

4. Create a "responsive_navigation" folder under libraries:

     sites/all/libraries/responsive_navigation

5. Unzip the archive and copy the following files to this folder.

   sites/all/libraries/responsive_navigation
     - responsive-nav.css
     - responsive-nav.js
     - responsive-nav.min.js

6. Turn on the module under:

     admin/modules

7. Enable the "Administer Responsive Navigation" permission.

     admin/people/permissions

8. Navigate to:

     admin/config/user-interface/responsive_navigation

   Enable 0 or 1 block. Use 0 if you just want to use the library and
   code the javascript functions directly into your theme templates.
   Use 1 if you want to create a menu block with responsive-nav.js.

9. If you chose 1 block, go the block region section in the admin and
   assign the new block to a region -- preferably near the top of your
   template.

     admin/structure/block

10. Configure the block you enabled.

      admin/structure/block/manage/responsive_navigation/1/configure

11. To uninstall, disable the Responsive Navigation module.

      admin/modules

    Go to the uninstall section, select the module and uninstall.

      admin/modules/uninstall

    Delete the plugin folder at:

      sites/all/libraries/responsive_navigation

    To delete the responsive-nav.js with Drush:

      drush rm-rnjs-plugin

      or

      drush rmrnjsplugin
