The Responsive Navigation module integrates the responsive-nav.js
plugin into Drupal.


Features
------------

Add a menu block provided by the Responsive Navigation module. Assign a
menu in the settings. Configure responsive-nav.js features in the block
such as animation speed, label and insertion point.

There's a built-in Drush command that let's you install or uninstall the
responsive-nav.js plugin from Github easily with a single command.

Refer to the INSTALL.TXT for installation instructions and usage.


Disclaimer
------------

responsive-nav.js only supports one menu at this time. So the module
only provides one menu block. The module will support more than one block
when responsive-nav.js adds support in the future.


Known Issues
------------

- responsive-nav.js supports only one menu.

- No themes are provided with the module. There are code samples in the
  responsive-nav archive and on their website.

- The menu block may disappear after the Drupal overlay closes. Resize the
  window to make the block reappear. The overlay only appears for admins
  so users should not see this.
